# rf-transmission-data-transmission
Transmission of data through the nRF24L01 Transceiver 2.4GHz, using the nrf24l01 arduino library and Python to tackle any statistical data.

The goal is to transmit binary data through the 2.4GHz channel, where it will be tested, corrected and analysed afterwards.
